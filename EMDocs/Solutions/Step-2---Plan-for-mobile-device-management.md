</alert><para>Managing mobile devices, both company-owned and user-owned, encompasses several important lifecycle management decisions. After you’ve determined the mobile device platform, application, and user requirements for your organization, you’ll also need to identify how to manage each of these areas in a way that aligns your overall MDM strategy with other management and support policies. In this step, we’ll examine the MDM enrollment, management, monitoring, and reporting lifecycle requirements.</para>

                <title>Device enrollment and configuration</title>
                <content>
                    <para>Mobile device management starts with the initial enrollment and configuration of devices into your mobile device management solution. Simplicity, ease of registration, and enrollment are the key factors for success in the mobile device management lifecycle. If initial device enrollment is difficult or overly confusing, both you and your users may be reluctant to go ahead with a mobile device management solution, which means you couldn’t leverage the features, benefits, and protections that the mobile device management solution can deliver.</para>
                <para>Mobile device enrollment in mobile device management solutions are typically initiated in two ways:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Administrator-managed enrollment</para></listItem><listItem><para>User/owner self-enrollment</para></listItem></list></content><content><para>Administrator-managed enrollment offers a centrally managed enrollment experience, and typically is centered on bulk enrollment of multiple devices using a single directory account. This is useful if you need to enroll many company-owned devices into your mobile device management solution.</para><para>With self-enrollment, the device user/owner enrolls their device in the mobile device management solution. This is typically used in “bring your own device” (BYOD) scenarios, although it can also be used in scenarios where the company owns the device. This type of enrollment typically uses a “push-based” enrollment model, where devices are automatically triggered to enroll in the mobile device management solution when the user tries to connect to the corporate network or network resource from the device. Users can sometimes also elect to enroll their devices before connecting to an organization’s network or resources.</para><para>Enrolling and configuring mobile devices includes the following:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Deploying, accessing, and managing internal and external applications and services</para></listItem><listItem><para>Enforcing device security and access configurations</para></listItem><listItem><para>Protecting devices from security threats</para></listItem></list><para>In most cases, when a mobile device is enrolled in a mobile device management solution, the device is automatically assigned policies and permissions that you have associated with the device user’s directory account and/or the group the device itself is associated with in directory services. Depending on the mobile device management solution, most of the configuring and provisioning of device policies and permissions is done before device enrollment. Then policy and compliance settings take effect as soon as the devices enroll, avoiding gaps between enrollment and compliance.</para><para><legacyBold>Device enrollment and configuration planning questions:</legacyBold> To plan for MDM lifecycle management, answer the following planning questions about device enrollment and configuration:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Will mobile devices be enrolled by you, by users, or both?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Do you need to ability to bulk-enroll mobile devices?</para></listItem><listItem><para>What is the maximum number of devices you’ll need to bulk-enroll? </para></listItem><listItem><para>Do the mobile operating system platforms in your organization require different bulk enrollment requirements and resources?</para></listItem><listItem><para>How many devices will each user typically use and need to enroll? </para></listItem><listItem><para>Does the mobile device management solution have a per-user device enrollment limit?</para></listItem><listItem><para>What are the requirements (connectivity, application, management agent, company portal, support) for users to self-enroll devices? </para></listItem><listItem><para>Is this different from the requirements for administrator-managed enrollment?</para></listItem><listItem><para>What are the enrollment requirements for each device operating system you need to support? </para></listItem><listItem><para>Do the mobile device operating systems in your organization require special or unique enrollment requirements?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Does the mobile device management solution support both connected and over-the-air enrollments?</para></listItem><listItem><para>What are the hardware requirements (if any) for supporting device enrollments?</para></listItem><listItem><para>What are the network connectivity and network security requirements for supporting device enrollments?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Do you need specific device compliance policies applied to devices upon initial enrollment?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Do you need specific device security policies applied to devices upon initial enrollment?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Do you need the ability to configure or set a maximum or minimum time limit for provisioning device policies after initial enrollment?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Do you require special provisioning policies to be automatically triggered in the event of enrollment failures?</para></listItem></list></content>

<title>Device management</title><content><para>How mobile devices are managed, both from your perspective and the device user’s perspective, is a key component of a mobile device management solution.</para><para>For example, you may want to integrate the way mobile devices are managed with how non-mobile devices (servers, desktops, other networked devices) are managed. Depending on the organization, non-mobile device management solutions may have been in place long before mobile devices were introduced to the organization. This may have been at considerable cost and may include long-term investments in these management solutions.</para><para>Thoroughly understanding how your organization can integrate mobile device management solutions with existing non-mobile device management solutions is likely one of the most important activities to complete when designing a mobile device management solution that meets the needs of your organization.</para><para>Mobile device management typically involves several administrative areas:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para><legacyBold>Device security and configuration: </legacyBold>Mobile device security includes a wide range of settings that you can deploy to managed devices in your organization.

More details about security and configuration are in  the <link xlink:href="5dffb570-dd1a-4beb-aa1e-7c0b51393704">Step 3 - Plan for securing mobile devices</link> topic.</para></listItem><listItem><para><legacyBold>Application management:</legacyBold> This area includes managing application deployment, installation, updating and managing status, and application removal. You can also manage restrictions on certain non-compliant applications, which can be central to an overall compliance and security strategy.</para></listItem><listItem><para><legacyBold>Company resource access:</legacyBold> MDM can also help manage access to on-premises network resources, such as email servers, Wi-Fi networks, and VPN-enabled resources. This serves a dual purpose of helping to insure security compliance and making it easier for mobile device users to access company resources according to company policy. If accessing organization resources is overly complex or difficult for mobile device users, they may opt to use non-approved company resources to store company data because it’s easier.</para></listItem><listItem><para><legacyBold>Inventory and reporting:</legacyBold> When you manage mobile devices, you’ll want to record and analyze mobile device and platform events to track compliance with the management policies in your organization. Detailed reporting can also provide you with real-time statistics and data so that you can make faster, better decisions based on the status of mobile devices and mobile device users.

<title>Device retirement/unenrollment</title><content><para>When users leave your organization or mobile devices are retired or replaced, you need to make sure that corporate data isn’t lost or compromised. Typically, mobile device management solutions support both IT-managed and user-managed device resets and unenrollment. With most mobile devices, unenrollment starts with resetting the device to factory defaults or performing a selective wipe of all corporate data and applications. Then the device enrollment connection to the management solution is removed. However, the process varies between mobile device manufacturers and device operating system platforms.</para><para><legacyBold>Device retirement/unenrollment planning questions:</legacyBold> Answer the following planning questions about device retirement and unenrollment:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Do you need the ability for both IT and users to unenroll mobile devices?</para></listItem><listItem><para>If a device is selectively wiped, should it be automatically unenrolled from the mobile device management solution?</para></listItem><listItem><para>If mobile device users can unenroll their mobile devices, how will the removal of corporate data and applications be verified?</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Is this different for devices that are selectively wiped and devices that are reset to the factory default setting?</para></listItem></list></listItem></list><alert class="note">

<title>Task 3: Determine network resource requirements</title><content><para>Enabling secure, managed access to a wide variety of corporate resources by mobile devices is an important feature of a mobile device management solution. While these resources have typically been located in on-premises networks, it’s more common now for resources to be hosted in addition on cloud-based web services and external networks.</para><para>How mobile devices connect to corporate email platforms, virtual private networks (VPNs), and corporate wireless (Wi-Fi) networks all play an important role in keeping corporate data and other resources protected from unauthorized access. Equally important is making it convenient and easy for mobile device users to have secure access these resources to avoid users finding a more convenient but not secure method of storing or accessing resources.</para></content>

<title>Email management</title><content><para>Corporate email is typically the primary data resource most users need access to on a corporate network, whether from a personally-owned or a company-owned mobile device. Accessing to email is also typically the connection that triggers initial mobile device enrollment. Being able to manage email access for mobile devices across both your existing non-mobile device management solution and the mobile device management solution helps avoid device coverage gaps and increases the protection for data stored on email servers.</para><para>Most mobile device management solutions provide email access protection by using one or both of the following features:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para><legacyBold>Email profiles:</legacyBold> By setting up and deploying email profiles, administrators can automatically configure mobile devices with appropriate email server information for users to connect to their email mailboxes. This helps users connect to the correct email server without having to remember the right email server endpoint names or network addresses. In addition, by removing an email profile, administrators can remove email from devices as part of device reset or selective wipe process. Email profile management can be a feature in non-mobile device management solution, or can be integrated with a mobile device management solution.</para></listItem><listItem><para><legacyBold>Conditional email access:</legacyBold> Conditional email access, or “managed” email access, typically focuses on security and compliance for accessing email on a mobile device rather than which endpoint the mobile device connects to. With conditional email access, a compliance policy is defined and assigned to individual users or devices or groups of users and/or devices. The policy outlines the prerequisites that have to be in place before a mobile device can connect to an email resource; for example, a PIN might be required on the device. The policy is typically enforced when the device first enrolls, but remains in place and active as long as the mobile device is enrolled in the mobile device management system.</para></listItem></list><para><legacyBold>Email management planning questions: </legacyBold>Answer the following planning questions about email management.</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>	How will mobile devices connect to your existing on-premises or cloud-hosted email system?</para></listItem><listItem><para>If mobile devices are already connecting to your existing email system, what connection type or protocol are the devices using to connect?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Will administrators or users (or a combination of both) be responsible for connecting mobile devices to your email system?

<title>Network connectivity management</title><content><para>Mobile devices typically connect to corporate networks and resources by using the following access technologies:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para><legacyBold>Wi-Fi:</legacyBold> Wireless access to corporate resources is typically provided as an on-premises network extension service for devices that are in close physical proximity to the on-premises network. This usually involves allowing mobile devices to connect to network resources as users roam from location-to-location in an on-premises office, such as conference and meeting rooms, different offices, or other on-premises areas. It can also include wireless access from remote locations over non-corporate managed wireless network access points, such as the user’s home network or a public wireless access point. To simplify connections to wireless networks, administrators usually manage these connections using wireless profiles that outline the specific settings mobile devices must have in place before they can connect to the wireless network. This may include automatically configuring a custom network name, network Service Set Identifier (SSID), security settings, network proxy, and whether or not the device should automatically connect to the wireless network when the device is in range.</para></listItem><listItem><para><legacyBold>Virtual Private Network (VPN):</legacyBold> Secure remote access to corporate resources often includes using a defined VPN connection type from the mobile device. This is often vendor-specific and includes the installation of a VPN application on the mobile device. Additionally, these VPN applications often use either digital certificates or separately managed user account credentials to authenticate the VPN connection. To simplify connections to VPNs, administrators can usually manage these connections using VPN profiles or the VPN management tools included with the VPN solution. Depending on integration support, managing VPN connections with the mobile device management solution may or may not be an option with certain VPN platforms.</para><alert class="note">

<title>Task 4e: Email management options</title><content><para>The main reason for implementing a mobile device management solution is usually to provide managed access to corporate email from mobile devices.

The primary difference is that you can implement more advanced email management options than you can in <token>MDM for Office 365</token>. For example, using <token>Intune</token> standalone, you can configure conditional email access to allow access mailboxes hosted on both <token>Exchange Online</token> and Exchange on-premises, as well as configure customized email profiles. <token>Intune</token> enables these features by using configuration and compliance policies.  Hybrid <token>Intune</token> and <token>ConfigMgr</token> deployments also supports conditional email access, but only for mailboxes hosted on <token>Exchange Online</token>.</para><para>In the scenario shown below in Figure 6, the user has enrolled their device in <token>Intune</token> and is now trying to access their corporate email using <token>Office 365</token> or Exchange on-premises. Based on the settings defined by the IT administrator at their company, <token>Intune</token> runs a policy verification process. In this scenario, the user’s access is granted if the device is encrypted, a passcode is set, and the device isn’t jail broken or rooted. If a user tries to access corporate email and their device is not enrolled, or not compliant based upon settings defined by the IT admin, the user will receive an email explaining why their access has been blocked along with steps for how to resolve the issue. </para><mediaLink>
