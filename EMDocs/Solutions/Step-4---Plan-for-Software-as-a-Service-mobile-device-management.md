</alert><para>The last step in designing a complete mobile device management strategy is to determine the requirements for the Software as a Service (SaaS) device management solution that you'll use to support mobile devices in your organization. In this step, we’ll examine SaaS platform types, characteristics such as scalability and accessibility, mobile device management connectivity, and integration with your on-premises infrastructure. </para>
    <para>More and more, organizations are starting to take advantage of the features and power of cloud computing infrastructure solutions to deliver services and applications to users. SaaS allows user and device services, applications, and activities to be centrally managed from a single location, regardless of the location of the user or device. If your organization is currently using (or planning to implement) SaaS services, it’s important to define how the solution will deliver these services to mobile devices in your organization and integrate with (or even replace) your on-premises mobile device management platform. In some cases, SaaS solution decisions may be completely separate or just a small part of how mobile devices will be managed in your organization. However, understanding the overall impact of the SaaS solution as it relates to managing mobile devices is an important part deploying a complete mobile device management solution. </para><para>You need to go over these key aspects of the SaaS solution to understand what it is a current requirement and what your organization plans for the future. If you don’t have the vision to define a long-term strategy for managing mobile devices and integration with cloud services adoption, your mobile device management solution may not be scalable as your organization’s business needs change.</para></introduction>

        <title>Task 1: Identify your SaaS requirements </title>
        <content>
            <para>Each SaaS solution will have different requirements, mobile device management features, and levels of integration with on-premises networks and platforms. Many SaaS solutions offer trial tenants or services for you to evaluate their features and functionality, which is an important part of determining which solution actually meets your needs. However, many SaaS solutions may have subtle differences in features and functionality, depending on the platform type.</para>
        <para>The majority of SaaS solutions are based on three types of cloud types:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Multi-tenant (public)</para></listItem><listItem><para>Private (dedicated)</para></listItem><listItem><para>Hybrid</para></listItem></list><para>Before making decisions on how you’ll use a SaaS solution to manage your mobile devices, you’ll also need to examine the differences between these types of cloud platform architectures and choose the one that best fits the overall needs of your organization. Individual SaaS solutions have differing levels of support for areas such as customization, feature configuration, integration, and collaborative functionality.</para></content>

                <title>SaaS cloud types</title>
                <content>
                    <para><legacyBold>Multi-tenant</legacyBold> SaaS solutions are what are typically called “public” cloud infrastructures. This is when the software architecture of the service is in a single instance, but serves multiple tenants or organizations. The solution is designed to provide every tenant a reserved share of its services, such as user or device management, configuration, and data support. The tenant accounts and services are separated virtually, with each tenant accessing the platform infrastructure in separate instances. Multi-tenant SaaS solutions also typically offer cost-savings earned from sharing the infrastructure and distributing the overhead costs amongst multiple tenants. Most mobile device management platforms are offered in a multi-tenant SaaS platform infrastructure.</para>
                <para><legacyBold>Private</legacyBold>, or dedicated cloud services are instances of SaaS solutions that are operated for a single organization or tenant. These can either be private cloud services hosted by the organization or private cloud services hosted by a 3rd party provider. Private cloud solutions also typically offer greater opportunities for customization, both in the areas of services and security. Some dedicated SaaS solutions offer mobile device management services as a part of larger private cloud tenant options.</para></content><content><para><legacyBold>Hybrid</legacyBold> SaaS solutions can offer a combination of either multi-tenant and private cloud infrastructures, or a combination of hosted (either multi-tenant or private) and on-premises cloud infrastructures. A hybrid infrastructure may also include leveraging an external cloud SaaS solution for delivering certain types of services (such as applications), but leveraging internal resources for other types of services. Most SaaS solutions offer the ability to support a hybrid cloud configuration, but may vary significantly on the depth and completeness of integration with on-premises or other hosted cloud platforms.</para><para><legacyBold>SaaS cloud type questions: </legacyBold>As part of SaaS management lifecycle planning, you’ll want to answer the following planning questions about cloud types:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>What level of security do I need for mobile device data stored in my SaaS solution?</para></listItem><listItem><para>How does the SaaS solution address intrusion detection and data loss prevention for mobile devices?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Does your organization have to comply with any regulatory, certification, or compliance requirements for mobile devices or data stored on mobile devices? If so, do these require a specific level of security, customization, scalability, or resiliency? How is compliance audited and reported?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Does the SaaS solution need connectivity with other cloud services or platforms that will manage mobile devices? If so, is this connectivity:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Pre-configured or standardized?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Customizable?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Supported by the platforms you need to connect to?</para></listItem></list></listItem><listItem><para>Do you need to connect your SaaS solution with an existing on-premises device management infrastructure? If so, is this connectivity:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Supported by your on-premises device management platform?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Supported by the SaaS solution?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Supported without the need for additional on-premises physical resources?</para></listItem></list></listItem><listItem><para>Will your cloud-based services, applications, and processes for mobile devices require different levels of security, customization, scalability, and resiliency?</para></listItem></list></content>
            </section><section>
<title>Scalability</title><content><para>Ease of scalability is one of the primary reasons for considering or deploying a SaaS solution for managing mobile devices in your organization. By definition, public SaaS solutions typically offer a virtually limitless ability to support any amount of users or mobile devices. Private and hybrid SaaS solutions may be subject to scaling limits, based of available organization resources. Scaling increases or decreases to support greater or lesser number of users or devices usually depends on a specific licensing model or per user/device pricing package for public clouds.</para><para><legacyBold>Scalability questions:</legacyBold> As part of SaaS management lifecycle planning, you’ll want to answer the following planning questions about cloud scalability:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>What type of short and long-term plans does your organization have for growth or contraction in mobile device and application support infrastructure?</para></listItem><listItem><para>How rapidly will your organization need to scale mobile device management support services upward or downward?</para></listItem><listItem><para>What are the initial number of mobile devices and/or users that need support in the SaaS solution? How likely is this number to change in the next year? The next 3 years? The next 5 years?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Does the number of mobile devices needing SaaS solution support change on a regular pattern (such as seasonally)? Does it change according to the number of active or inactive organization projects</para></listItem><listItem><para>Does SaaS solution performance change depending on the scale of supported mobile device and users? If so, in what areas? (nodes, data, processing, etc.) How is the scaling performance measured, reported, and audited?</para></listItem></list></content>
</section><section>
<title>Accessibility</title><content><para>Easy access to the SaaS solution is another key component of the SaaS architecture. Because the SaaS solution is hosted on a cloud-based infrastructure, it’s accessible by administrators, users, and devices from any location that has access to the Internet. Administration of mobile devices is done via a browser. Because many SaaS solution providers operate geographically diverse datacenters, users and devices can access the platform “locally”, often avoiding latency and delays that can be associated with connecting to geographically distant endpoints. Accessibility can also typically be expanded by integrating the SaaS solution with on-premises device management platforms.</para><para>Accessibility questions: As part of SaaS management lifecycle planning, you’ll want to answer the following planning questions about cloud accessibility:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Are there specific mobile device browser requirements in your organization? If so, does the SaaS solution support the required browser(s)?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Do mobile device users need any special accessibility requirements for applications or services?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Does your organization need to access the SaaS infrastructure located in the same geographic as the user devices or your on-premises infrastructure? Are there legal ramifications if mobile device data is stored or moved across international borders?</para></listItem></list></content>
</section><section>
<title>Resiliency</title><content><para>Since the SaaS infrastructure is cloud-based and hosted across multiple datacenters, resiliency is typically subject to less instability or outages than traditional on-premises hosted services. Multi-location service hosts offer protection against geographic-based outages and service interruptions by using fail-over infrastructure and processes to replicate data across multiple datacenter nodes. Depending on the SaaS solution, access to the service may or may not remain in the original geographic area during a fail-over.</para><para>Resiliency questions: As part of SaaS management lifecycle planning, you’ll want to answer the following planning questions about cloud resiliency:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>In the event of primary SaaS solution fail-over, how will mobile device management services be impacted?</para></listItem><listItem><para>How will mobile device data stored on the SaaS solution be shared in the cloud-based infrastructure?</para></listItem><listItem><para>If the primary mobile device SaaS datacenter isn’t available, are the fail-over datacenters in the same geographic region as the primary datacenter? Is it OK for fail-over datacenters to be located outside the international borders from which the mobile devices are operating?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Does the SaaS solution have a defined service level agreement (SLA) outlining support for mobile device management?</para></listItem></list></content>
</section><section>
<title>Up-to-date services</title><content><para>SaaS solutions also are able to keep the applications and services up-to-date with the latest application version, features, security updates, and bug fixes. Often these updates are published very quickly, sometimes even on a daily basis. Depending on the SaaS solution, updates may be instantly available to all customers or released in a phased approach to smaller groups of customers. One of the biggest benefits is that when a bug is fixed for one customer, the fix can be easily applied to all customers using the service.</para><para>Services questions: As part of SaaS management lifecycle planning, you’ll want to answer the following planning questions about cloud services:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>How often are mobile device management features and functionality updated in the SaaS service?</para></listItem><listItem><para>What impact will feature and functionality updates have on your mission-critical mobile device applications and services? </para></listItem><listItem><para>Are SaaS solution feature and functionality updates deployed to customers on an ad hoc or planned schedule?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Does the SaaS solution support exemptions from service-wide updates for individual organizations? </para></listItem><listItem><para>Does the SaaS solution have different service update schedules for mobile device application and mobile device management features and functionality?</para></listItem></list></content>
</section></sections>
    </section>
    <section>
<title>Task 2: Identify your SaaS solution / on-premises infrastructure integration needs </title><content><para>One of the primary decisions that need to be made when considering managing mobile devices with a SaaS solution are:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>How will your existing user and device on-premises directory accounts integrate with the SaaS solution?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Do you need to integrate the SaaS solution with existing on-premises client management platforms?</para><para>The decisions you make in these two areas will significantly impact the overall deployment, administration, and end-user experiences for your mobile device management solution.</para></listItem></list></content>
<sections><section>
<title>Identity and directory connectivity</title><content><para>Connecting and synchronizing your on-premises user and device account directory with the SaaS solution is really the glue that truly connects users, mobile devices, mobile applications, and mobile device management. Knowing who a user is (identity) and associating the identity to specific mobile devices is critical in managing access to company resources and data from the mobile device. In many ways, maximizing how these areas are connected to the SaaS solution determines the overall value to both you and your mobile device users.  Ubiquitous connectivity means that people and devices can use devices and applications anywhere, and it’s essential that user identity management keeps pace with the demands of this connectivity. It can’t be stressed enough that how you manage identity and user authentication is critical to the success of your mobile device management solution.</para><para>Synchronizing on-premises directory services to the SaaS solution is another key area to consider when defining your mobile device management strategy. Most organizations prefer to maintain an on-premises user and device directory infrastructure, but need to extend these accounts to a variety of cloud-based services. This may include only a SaaS-based mobile device management solution, but in most scenarios organizations need to integrate user and device accounts into several different types of cloud-based services. This may include cloud-based applications, data, or 3rd party web services. Keeping your user and device directory accounts synchronized is the cornerstone of a well-designed identity management solution. Once you integrate your on-premises directory with cloud directory, you can also enable single sign-on (SSO) to allow users to sign into all services using their on-premises credentials. Both <token>Intune</token> and Office 365 can take advantage of this integration to enable SSO with SaaS apps that the organization might want to use. </para><para>Identity and directory connectivity questions: As part of SaaS management lifecycle planning, you’ll want to answer the following planning questions about identity management and directory connectivity:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Does the SaaS solution support integrated user authentication services? If so, does it support the type of directory services you’re using in your on-premises infrastructure?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Do you need to support user and mobile device authentication for on-premises and/or internal applications or services?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Does the SaaS solution support user and mobile device authentication for 3rd party or other external SaaS-based applications or services?</para></listItem><listItem><para>How does the SaaS solution manage identity-related threats and abnormalities?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Does the SaaS solution support implementing and managing multi-factor authentication (MFA)?</para></listItem><listItem><para>	What types of directory services objects do you need to extend to the SaaS solution? Does the SaaS solution have any restrictions for certain object types?</para></listItem><listItem><para>What on-premises requirements are needed to extend your directory services to the SaaS solution? </para></listItem><listItem><para>Once connected to the SaaS solution, how are user and mobile device directory objects replicated or synchronized with the cloud service? Are synchronization settings customizable or fixed?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Are all directory object attributes synchronized with the SaaS solution? Do you need to synchronize custom directory object attributes?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Are on-premises directory services hosted in a single location or logical grouping? If not, does the SaaS solution support synchronizing multiple directory services from multiple locations and logical groupings? </para></listItem></list></content>
</section><section>
<title>Connecting with existing client management platforms</title><content><para>Most organizations have an existing on-premises client management platform to manage desktop computers and servers. How you integrate the management of mobile devices into this system is likely to have a substantial impact on IT infrastructure costs, device management administration processes, device inventory and reporting support, and overall integration with other business-critical applications and services. By connecting these two platforms, organizations are able to leverage the economies of scale of a single, unified management platform.</para><para>Connecting existing client management platforms questions: As part of SaaS management lifecycle planning, you’ll want to answer the following planning questions about connecting the SaaS solution with existing client management platforms:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Does your on-premises client management platform support integration with SaaS solution? If so, are there:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Limitations on the type of SaaS solution?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Limitations on the types of supported devices?</para></listItem></list></listItem><listItem><para>What are the requirements to connect your on-premises client management platform to the SaaS solution? Specifically, are there:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Physical server or device requirements?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Directory services or directory schema requirements?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Domain Name Services (DNS) requirements?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Identity requirements</para></listItem><listItem><para>Client management platform upgrades or configuration requirements?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Network connectivity and/or network security configuration requirements?</para></listItem></list></listItem><listItem><para>Can existing client or device configuration information (policies, profiles, and settings) be shared or leveraged in the SaaS solution? Will this information have to be recreated?</para></listItem><listItem><para>After the two platforms are connected, how are clients managed? Are different types of clients managed in a unified administration system or are they managed separately?</para></listItem><listItem><para>How are updates and changes in the SaaS solution integrated with the on-premises client management platform?
