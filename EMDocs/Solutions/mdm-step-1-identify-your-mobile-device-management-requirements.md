# Step 1 - Identify your mobile device management requirements

The first step in designing a mobile device management solution is to determine the management platform requirements that will be used to support your mobile devices. Overall mobile device adoption for your company will dictate the platform requirements. If you decide to adopt a single management solution to manage all your mobile devices, you may disregard the multi-platform requirements for your solution. You’ll need to go over your company’s business strategy to fully understand your current and future business requirements. If you don’t have a long-term strategy for mobile device adoption, chances are that your solution won’t be scalable as your business needs grow and change.
