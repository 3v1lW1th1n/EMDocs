# Onboarding phases

When you use the [FastTrack Center Benefit Eligible Services and Plans](fasttrack-center-benefit-for-enterprise-mobility-suite-ems.md) to get Microsoft Azure Active Directory Premium and Microsoft Intune ready for use, there are several phases involved in the process. The following sections describe each phase of the onboarding process.

Onboarding has four primary phases:

![The four phases of the FastTrack onboarding process](./media/ft-onboarding-benefit.png)


## Initiate phase

After you purchase the appropriate number of licenses, follow the guidance from the purchase confirmation email to associate the licenses to your existing tenant or new tenant. Microsoft then verifies your eligibility for the FastTrack Center Benefit and tries to contact you to offer onboarding assistance.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also request assistance from the [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/) if you're ready to deploy these services for your organization.

### To request assistance

1. Go to [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/) and sign in with your work or school account.

2. On the Customer Dashboard, choose **Go to FastTrack** at the bottom right of the page.

3. On the FastTrack Dasboard, expand the **Need Help** at the bottom right of the page, and then follow the prompts to complete your request.

Once the onboarding support starts, FastTrack sets up a schedule of online meetings with you to discuss the onboarding process, verify data, and set up a kick-off meeting.

![Onboarding initiate phase](./media/ft-initiate-phase.png)

## Assess phase

Once the onboarding process begins, the FastTrack Center works with you to assess your source environment and the requirements. Tools are run to assess your environment, and FastTrack Specialists guide you through assessing your on-premises Active Directory, Internet browsers, client devices' operating systems, Domain Name System (DNS), network, infrastructure, and identity system to determine if any changes are required for onboarding.

The FastTrack Center also connects you with guidance about how to drive successful adoption of the eligible services.

Based on your current setup, we provide a remediation plan that brings your source environment up to the minimum requirements for successful onboarding to EMS or its individual cloud services. We also set up appropriate checkpoint calls for the remediation phase.

![Onboarding assess phase](./media/ft-assess-phase.png)

## Remediate phase
You perform the tasks in the remediation plan on your source environment so that you meet the requirements for onboarding and adopting each service (as needed).

![Onboarding remediate phase](./media/ft-remediate-phase.png)

Before you begin the Enable phase, we jointly verify the outcomes of the remediation activities to make sure youâ€™re ready to proceed.

## Enable phase
When all remediation activities are complete, the project shifts to configuring the core infrastructure for service consumption and to provisioning each eligible EMS cloud service.

**Enable phase - Core capabilities**

Core onboarding involves service provisioning and tenant and identity integration. It also includes steps for providing a foundation for onboarding online services such as Azure AD Premium and Intune.

> WAP stands for Web Application Proxy. SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. SDS stands for School Data Sync. For more information on SDS, see [Welcome to Microsoft School Data Sync](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=871480).

> [!NOTE]
> A managed authentication method includes, but is not limited to password hash synchronization. Identity integration is a one time activity and does not include migrating or decommissioning of existing authentication methods, such as managed or federated.

### Enable phase - Azure AD Premium

The Azure AD Premium environment can be set up by using the Azure Active Directory Connect tool directory synchronization and Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) (as needed).

For Azure AD Premium scenarios that include synchronizing on-premises identities to the cloud, we help you by adding IT admins and users to your subscription, configuring management prerequisites, setting up Azure AD Premium, setting up directory synchronization with managed authentication and AD FS using the Azure AD Connect tool, configuring test users, and validating your core use cases for the service.

Azure AD Premium setup includes enabling the following features:

-   Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR).

-   Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (Azure MFA).

-   Up to three (3) or more Software as a Service (SaaS) application integrations with single sign-on (SSO) from the [Azure Active Directory Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/active-directory/).

-   Automatic user provisioning for pre-integrated SaaS applications as listed in the [App integration tutorial list](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/tutorial-list), limited to outbound provisioning only.

-   Customized logon screen, including logo, text, and images.

-   Self-Service and Dynamic Groups (Groups).

-   Azure Active Directory Application Proxy.

-   Azure Active Directory Connect Health.

-   Identity Protection.

-   Privileged Identity Management.

-   Azure Active Directory Conditional Access, including Terms of Use, if required.
