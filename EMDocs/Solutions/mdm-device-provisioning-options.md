# Device provisioning options

When a user can use and enroll their own device, this increases the requirements for both the user and IT, and impacts several areas. For example, Figure 4 shows an overview of the enrollment process for an organization using both <token>Intune</token> and <token>ConfigMgr</token>. This example outlines the certificate, web application, and synchronization considerations that you’ll need to consider when planning your solution:

**Overview of the enrollment process for mobile devices using hybrid Intune and ConfigMgr**

1. With <token>Windows Server 2012 R2</token>, a new concept known as device registration was introduced.  Users can register their devices for single sign-on and access to corporate data using Workplace Join.  As part of this registration process, a certificate is installed on the device. In return for registering their device and making in known to the device management solution, the user gains access to corporate resources that were previously not available outside of their domain-joined PC.
2. Users can enroll devices which configure the device for management with <token>Intune</token> <externalLink target="_blank"><linkText>using the Company Portal</linkText><linkUri>https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646957.aspx</linkUri></externalLink>, and then leverage the <token>Microsoft Intune Company Portal</token> for easy access to corporate applications, data and to be able to manage their own devices, performing tasks such as remote wiping them in the event they are lost, stolen or replaced.
3. You can publish access to corporate resources with the built in capability available in <token>Windows Server 2012 R2</token> called <externalLink target="_blank"><linkText>Web Application Proxy</linkText><linkUri>https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn584107.aspx</linkUri></externalLink> based on device awareness (i.e. is it registered) and the users identity. Multi-factor authentication can be used through <externalLink><linkText>Azure Active Authentication</linkText><linkUri>https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn249466.aspx</linkUri></externalLink>.
4. In order to provide administrators with a unified view of their entire environment, the data from <token>Intune</token> is synchronized with ConfigMgr which provides unified management across both on-premises and in the cloud.
5. As part of the enrollment process, a new device object is created in <token>Active Directory</token>.  This device object establishes a link between the user and their device, making it known to the device management solution, and allowing the device to be authenticated, effectively a seamless two-factor authentication.

Depending on how you answered the questions in Task 1, you should be able to determine how you want devices to be managed in the mobile device management solution. Table 6 below shows the advantages and disadvantages of each provisioning option.
