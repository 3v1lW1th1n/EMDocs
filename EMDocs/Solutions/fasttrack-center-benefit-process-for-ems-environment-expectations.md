# Source Environment Expectations

When you use the [FastTrack Center Benefit for Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS)](fasttrack-center-benefit-for-enterprise-mobility-suite-ems.md) to get Microsoft Azure Active Directory Premium and Microsoft Intune ready for use, your environment needs to meet the expectations described in the following sections.

You may already have on-premises Active Directory in your organization that you want to integrate with EMS or any of its individual services for leveraging rich identity management from a single console. The FastTrack Center Benefit for EMS includes helping you integrate Azure Active Directory with your existing on-premises Active Directory environment.

The following table shows expectations for your existing source environment for on-boarding.
