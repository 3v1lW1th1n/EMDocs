# FastTrack Center Benefit Process for Enterprise Mobility Suite - overview

You can use the [FastTrack Center Benefit for Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS)](fasttrack-center-benefit-for-enterprise-mobility-suite-ems.md) to get Azure Active Directory Premium, Microsoft Intune and/or Azure Rights Management ready for use. Use the information in this section to get an illustrated overview of the onboarding process.

To read about the other parts of the FastTrack onboarding process, see [FastTrack Center Benefit Process for Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS)](fasttrack-center-benefit-process-for-enterprise-mobility-suite-ems.md).


Onboarding has two major components:

-   **Core onboarding** - tasks required for tenant configuration and integration with Azure Active Directory, if needed. Core onboarding also provides the baseline for onboarding other Microsoft Online eligible services.

-   **Service onboarding** - tasks required to configure any of the standalone variants of the EMS suite (Azure Active Directory Premium, Microsoft Intune, Azure Rights Management Premium).

The following diagram describes the high-level onboarding phases of using the FastTrack Center Benefit.

The basic process is as follows:

- Microsoft will try to contact you to offer onboarding assistance, after you purchase licenses of an eligible service. You can also request assistance from the [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/) if you are ready to deploy these services for your organization. To request assistance, sign in to the [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/) (http://fasttrack.microsoft.com), go to the dashboard, click the Offers tab, and click on “Request Assistance for Microsoft Intune, Azure Active Directory Premium or Azure Rights Management Premium”. Once onboarding support starts, we’ll set up a schedule of online meetings.

-   The Microsoft Onboarding team will help you with core capabilities, common for all Microsoft Online Services, and then will help you onboard each eligible service.

All onboarding support will be provided remotely by assigned Microsoft personnel:

-   Microsoft will remotely assist you with various onboarding activities by using a combination of tools, documentation, and guidance.

-   Onboarding support is provided by the FastTrack Center, and is available during normal business hours for a given region.

-   Onboarding support is available in Traditional Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (Brazil), or Spanish.

-   The Microsoft team can work directly with you or your representative.
