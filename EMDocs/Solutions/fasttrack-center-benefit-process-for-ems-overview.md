# FastTrack Center Benefit Overview

With FastTrack Center Benefit for Azure Active Directory Premium and/or Microsoft Intune, you work remotely with Microsoft specialists to get your environment ready for use, and plan rollout and usage within your organization. To learn more about eligibility, see [FastTrack Center Benefit Process for Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS)](fasttrack-center-benefit-process-for-enterprise-mobility-suite-ems.md).


Onboarding has two major components:

-   **Core onboarding** - tasks required for tenant configuration and integration with Azure Active Directory, if needed. Core onboarding also provides the baseline for onboarding other Microsoft Online eligible services.

-   **Service onboarding** - tasks required to configure any of the standalone variants of the EMS workoad (Azure Active Directory Premium, Microsoft Intune).

The following diagram describes the high-level onboarding phases of using the FastTrack Center Benefit.

Here's how the process works:

- Microsoft will try to contact you to offer onboarding assistance, after you purchase licenses of an eligible service. You can also request assistance from the [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/) if you are ready to deploy these services for your organization. To request assistance, sign in to the [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/) (http://fasttrack.microsoft.com) with your work or school account, go to the dashboard, click your company (or add it if needed), click the Services tab, and click “Request Assistance for Microsoft Intune or Azure Active Directory Premium”. Once onboarding support starts, we’ll set up a schedule of online meetings.

-   The Microsoft Onboarding team will help you with core capabilities, common for all Microsoft Online Services, and then help you onboard each eligible service.

All onboarding support will be provided remotely by assigned Microsoft personnel:

-   Microsoft will remotely assist you with various onboarding activities by using a combination of tools, documentation, and guidance.

-   Onboarding support is provided by the FastTrack Center, and is available during normal business hours for a given region.

-   Onboarding support is available in Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Thai, and Vietnamese.

-   The Microsoft team can work directly with you or your representative.
