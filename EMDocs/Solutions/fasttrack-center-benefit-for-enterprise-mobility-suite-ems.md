# FastTrack Center Benefit Eligible Services and Plans
You can use the service benefit when you purchase at least 150 licenses for EMS or any of its individual cloud services in an eligible plan. The service benefit lets you work with Microsoft specialists to assess, remediate, and enable eligible services.

The eligible services and plans are described below.

To learn about the FastTrack Center process and who's responsible for what, see [FastTrack Center Benefit Process for Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS)](fasttrack-center-benefit-process-for-enterprise-mobility-suite-ems.md).

Are you looking for information about Microsoft FastTrack for Office 365? See [FastTrack Center Benefit for Office 365](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/office-365-onboarding-benefit.aspx).

## Eligible services
If you purchase any of the following Microsoft online services through an eligible plan, Microsoft will help you onboard to them, and will try to contact you to offer onboarding assistance. You can also request assistance from the [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/) if you are ready to deploy these services for your organization. To request assistance, sign in to the [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/) (http://fasttrack.microsoft.com), go to the dashboard, click the Offers tab, and click “Request Assistance for Microsoft Azure Active Directory Premium or Intune”. Once onboarding support starts, we’ll set up a schedule of online meetings.

Customers can opt-in to the onboarding process once per each eligible Microsoft online service.
