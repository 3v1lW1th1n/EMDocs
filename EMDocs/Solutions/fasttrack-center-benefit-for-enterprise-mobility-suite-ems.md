# FastTrack Center Benefit for Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS)
You can use the service benefit when you purchase at least 150 licenses for EMS or any of its individual cloud services in an eligible plan. The service benefit lets you work with Microsoft specialists to assess, remediate, and enable eligible services.

This article provides details about plan and service eligibility for the service benefit.

To learn about the onboarding process as well as roles and responsibilities, see [FastTrack Center Benefit Process for Intune](FastTrack-Center-Benefit-Process-for-Intune.md).

## Eligible services
If you purchase any of the following Microsoft online services through an eligible plan, Microsoft will help you onboard to them, and will try to contact you to offer onboarding assistance. You can also request assistance from the [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/) if you are ready to deploy these services for your organization. To request assistance, sign in to the [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/) (http://fasttrack.microsoft.com), go to the dashboard, click the Offers tab, and click on “Request Assistance for Microsoft Intune, Azure Active Directory Premium or Azure Rights Management Premium”. Once onboarding support starts, we’ll set up a schedule of online meetings

Customers can opt-in to the onboarding process once per each eligible Microsoft online service.
