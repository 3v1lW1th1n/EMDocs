# Plan for enhancing mobile devices protection

While on-premises and remote users can be more productive by accessing company resources on their mobile devices, letting them to do also increases security threats that you’ll need to mitigate in order to help protect your company’s data and maintain user privacy. Your company might have specific requirements about how to balance these needs. Compliance rules can vary depending on the industry in which your company operates, for example, which may lead to different design decisions.
 
However, there are some general aspects of security in mobile device management to explore and conform to, regardless of the industry. These are shown in the figure below.

## Security capabilities in a MDM solution

This diagram shows the core security capabilities required in any MDM solution. The key areas to consider are the following:

1. Considerations for data protection at the mobile device level:
	- Data encryption
	- Data classification
	- Client privacy
	- Containerization
	- Policy enforcement
	- Compliance policies
	- Hardening
2. Considerations for data protection while in transit:
	- Data encryption
	- Authentication
	- Authorization
3. Considerations for data protection while at rest in your on-premises organization:
	- Data encryption
	- Authentication
	- Authorization
4. Considerations for data protection while at rest in the cloud:
	- Data encryption
	- Authentication
	- Authorization

The tasks described in the sections that follow can help you understand how your specific security needs will influence your decision about the best MDM solution for your business requirements.
