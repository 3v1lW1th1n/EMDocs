</alert><para>The first step in designing a mobile device management solution is to determine the management platform requirements that will be used to support your mobile devices. Overall mobile device adoption for your company will dictate the platform requirements. If you decide to adopt a single management solution to manage all your mobile devices, you may disregard the multi-platform requirements for your solution. You’ll need to go over your company’s business strategy to fully understand your current and future business requirements. If you don’t have a long-term strategy for mobile device adoption, chances are that your solution won’t be scalable as your business needs grow and change. </para>

    <section>
<title>Task 1: Identify your business needs</title><content><para>Each company will have different requirements. Even if these companies are part of the same industry, the real business requirements might vary. You can still leverage best practices from the industry, but ultimately it’s the company’s business needs that will identify the requirements for the mobile device management solution:
</para><para><legacyBold>Device ownership:</legacyBold> You must understand the device ownership policy for your company:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Who owns the mobile device?</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>The employee?</para></listItem><listItem><para>The company?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Both?</para></listItem></list></listItem></list><para><legacyBold>Platform:</legacyBold> Understanding which mobile device operating systems will be used by the company is very important for adoption and supportability decisions:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>	Which mobile device operating systems will be supported?
</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>	Android?</para></listItem><listItem><para>	iOS?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Windows?</para></listItem><listItem><para><token>Windows Phone</token>?</para></listItem><listItem><para>All of them?</para></listItem><listItem><para>A mix of the above options?</para></listItem></list></listItem><listItem><para>Which mobile OS version will be supported?</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Only the latest?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Current -1 (current version plus the previous version)?</para></listItem></list></listItem></list><para><legacyBold>Application:</legacyBold> Since the main reason to embrace mobility is to increase productivity, the applications (apps) used by employees must be able to run in all the mobile device operating systems used in your organization. This is an important point to consider, because while some companies might have their most important apps fully portable to run in a mobile environment, others might need to understand what options are available that can help them to deploy their apps to mobile devices. To assist you identifying individual app requirements, ask yourself the following questions:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>	Do the apps require Internet access from users’ devices? </para></listItem><listItem><para>	Do the apps collect any user personal information?</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>If so, do the apps inform users about privacy issues and data collection while being installed?</para></listItem></list></listItem><listItem><para>	Do the apps require integration with cloud services?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Were the apps developed to run on a specific operating system, or are they capable of running on any operating system?</para></listItem><listItem><para>	Do you plan to enable users to use apps via remote desktop from their own devices?</para></listItem><listItem><para>	Do the apps require full-time access to corporate resources, or can they run in offline mode?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Do the apps have any integration with social networks?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Will all apps be available to BYOD users?</para></listItem><listItem><para>How do you plan to deploy these apps to users’ devices?</para></listItem><listItem><para>	What are the deployment options for these apps?</para></listItem><listItem><para>Does the installation requirement vary according to the target device, or is it the same?</para></listItem><listItem><para>	How much space in a target device is necessary in order to install each app? </para></listItem><listItem><para>	Do the apps encrypt the data before transmitting it through the network from the users’ devices to the app server on the back end?</para></listItem><listItem><para>	Can the apps be remotely uninstalled via the network, or do they need to be uninstalled via the devices’ consoles?</para></listItem><listItem><para>	Do the apps work in a low-latency network? </para></listItem><listItem><para>	Do the apps provide authentication capabilities?</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>	If so, which authentication method do the apps use?</para></listItem></list></listItem><listItem><para>	How much space in a target device is necessary in order to install each app?</para></listItem></list><para><legacyBold>	User:</legacyBold> One of the main points in embracing mobility is to put the user at the center of the mobility solution and enabling the user to be more productive, while keeping company data secure and available. This is important to understand what the user’s requirements are:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Will the user be able to bring their own device and access company’s resources?</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>If yes, what are the requirements to access company’s resources?</para></listItem></list></listItem><listItem><para>Does your company have different user’s needs?</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>If yes, how each user’s profile will impact the mobility strategy?</para></listItem></list></listItem><listItem><para>	Will users be able to access all apps that they have access to in the on-premises environment via their mobile device?</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>If not, which apps will be available for the users?</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Are those apps available for all supported mobile device platforms?</para></listItem><listItem><para>	Will be necessary to modify or update any apps in order to run them on all supported mobile device platforms?</para></listItem></list></listItem></list></listItem><listItem><para>Do your users only need basic access to email (including calendar, contacts, and tasks) features?</para></listItem></list><para>During this task, you should also evaluate if the company has existing management and compliance policies in place for mobile devices and how these policies might affect the mobile device management solution selection.</para><alert class="note">
 <para>Make sure to take notes of each answer and understand the rationale behind the answer. Task 3 will go over the available options and advantages/disadvantages of each option.  By having answered these questions, you’ll be able to select which solution best suits your business needs.</para>

<title>Task 2: Specify your mobile device management location requirements</title><content><para>Location requirements are one of the many factors that you should take in consideration when designing your mobile device management strategy. Location is important from the mobile device management solution perspective as well as from the device itself. Answer the following questions:</para><para><legacyBold>	Track Users:</legacyBold> For some kinds of mobile device control, you might need to implement policies that can restrict access to company resources based on a user’s location:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Does the company need to implement mechanisms to cover geo-fencing, or the ability to enforce policies based on the geographic location of the device? </para></listItem><listItem><para>Does the company need to keep track of where the user was geographically located when they accessed a company resource?</para></listItem></list><para><legacyBold>Administration model:</legacyBold> Depending on the mobile device management solution that you deploy, administration can be distributed in different sites (locations) or centralized in a single location. A central administration site is suitable for large-scale deployments and provides a central point of administration and the flexibility to support devices that are distributed across a global network infrastructure. A primary site is suitable for smaller deployments, though it has fewer options to accommodate future growth. Determine if MDM control should be centralized or distributed:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Does your company need a centralized administration model?</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>Does the device management solution need to be located on-premises?</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>If not, can it be located in the cloud?</para></listItem><listItem><para>If not, can it be hybrid?</para></listItem></list></listItem></list></listItem><listItem><para>Does your company need a decentralized model where different locations should have autonomy over the device management administration?</para></listItem></list><alert class="note">
 <para>Make sure to take notes of each answer and understand the rationale behind the answer. Task 3 will go over the available options and advantages/disadvantages of each option.  By having answered these questions, you’ll be able to select which solution best suits your business needs.</para>

<title>Task 3d: Track requirements</title><content><para>Understanding user behavior and being able to identify their location are important factors to include in your mobile device management strategy. How devices will be tracked will vary according to your business requirements and needs.  Different tracking capabilities are available in each mobile operating system so the mobile device platforms you choose to support will impact your options. For example, compliance requirements may influence you to prioritize adopting mobile devices platforms that allow you to track user’s location and use geofencing. </para><alert class="note">
 <para>Geofencing allows you to monitor a mobile device’s geographic location and enable/disable device and network resources based on that location. For example, Windows 8.1 supports geofencing, which allows an app to define a geographical region and have the system alert the app when the device it's running on enters or exits that area. For more information about this feature in Windows 8.1, read <externalLink target="_blank"><linkText>Geofencing, start to finish (XAML)</linkText><linkUri>https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/dn342943.aspx</linkUri></externalLink>. </para>

<title>Task 3e: Administration model</title><content><para>The administration model that you will choose will vary according to your business requirements. If the mobile device management solution needs to be located on-premises, you must evaluate what capabilities are available in your current infrastructure to accommodate mobile device management based on devices that can be located in the cloud or on-premises.</para><para>After evaluating this, you might decide that you should keep the core management on-premises and integrate with a cloud mobile device management solution, which leads you to choose the hybrid scenario. Review Table 1 to see advantages and disadvantages of using standalone, cloud, or hybrid MDM solution.</para><alert class="note">
 <para>Be aware that <token>Intune</token> standalone has limited capabilities for delegated admin. <token>ConfigMgr</token> in a hybrid scenario provides greater control and delegation for delegated admin. </para>
</alert><para>One strategic aspect of how an organization will manage their mobile devices is to understand the current management platform capabilities and the administration model in place. For example, organizations that have a headquarters and multiple branch offices might be using a distributed administration model where each branch office has control over the management platform for that location.</para><para>Most of the time, an administration model is already in place when a company decides to embrace mobility by deploying a mobile device management solution. However, you must ensure that the current infrastructure will be able to handle the requirements introduced by the adoption of a mobile device management solution.</para><para>Figure 2 is an example of an organization with a central administration site, with multiple primary sites and multiple secondary sites:</para><mediaLink>

In this case, the company already has a device management solution in place for managing their on-premises devices.
</para><para>With an administration model like the one shown in Figure 2, you have the following advantages:</para><list class="bullet"><listItem><para>You can schedule and throttle network traffic when you distribute deployment content to distribution points. </para></listItem><listItem><para>Discovery data records (DDRs) for unknown resource transfers by using file-based replication from a primary site to the central administration site for processing. </para></listItem><listItem><para>Role-based administration provides a central security model for the hierarchy, and you do not have to install sites to provide a security boundary. Instead, use security scopes, security roles, and collections to define what administrators can see and manage in the hierarchy. </para></listItem></list><alert class="note">

</alert><para>You can deploy <token>ConfigMgr</token> using a single stand-alone primary site, or as multiple sites in a hierarchy. When you plan your initial deployment, consider a design that can scale for future growth in your organization. Planning for expansion is important because the changes from previous versions of the product mean that <token>ConfigMgr</token> can now support more clients with fewer sites.</para><para>High availability factors should also be considered when designing your management hierarchy. At each site that will have <token>ConfigMgr</token> installed, you deploy site system roles to provide the services that you want clients to use at that site. The site database contains the configuration information for the site and for all clients. This allows you to provide high availability of the site database, and the recovery of the site and site database if needed. </para><alert class="note">

</alert><para>Another important point to consider regarding administration model is how you will delegate administration to your resources. Ideally the management platform will be able to use role base access control (RBAC). While this is one method of restricting and managing control of what users, operators and administrators can perform, it is not the only method and it might not be required for the business. <link xlink:href="5dffb570-dd1a-4beb-aa1e-7c0b51393704">Step 3 - Plan for securing mobile devices</link> of this document will cover RBAC in more details and how to identify the need to use this capability.</para></content>
