# Use conditional access with Intune and Configuration Manager
In this solution, you are already using System Center Configuration Manager and Microsoft Exchange Server – with on-premises, Exchange Online, or a hybrid deployment of both – in your company to manage email access. This solution combines your existing Configuration Manager environment with Intune to safely manage email access on all types of devices, regardless of their location.
