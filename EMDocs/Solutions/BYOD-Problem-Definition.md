  <introduction>
    <para>The following problems or challenges are typically the ones encountered by companies trying to embrace BYOD:</para>
    <list class="bullet">
      <listItem>
        <para>The existing management platform is unable to allow users to bring their own devices and have access to company resources. </para>
      </listItem>
      <listItem>
        <para>The security strategy already in place does not address the security challenges that BYOD introduces to the environment. </para>
      </listItem>
      <listItem>
        <para>Users are embracing new technologies and demanding access to company resources to perform their jobs. </para>
      </listItem>
      <listItem>
        <para>Business decision makers understand the benefits that BYOD brings to the business, primarily in user productivity that can decrease operation cost. However, business decision makers are uncertain how to embrace BYOD while remaining in compliance with rules and regulations.</para>
      </listItem>
    </list>
    <para>Organizations with a large infrastructure need to determine requirements before shifting from managing devices themselves—which assumes that IT has total control of devices—to a model in which IT must assume that it has less control of devices and at the same time needs to address users’ needs to access corporate data. This is often referred to as a switch from device-centric to people-centric IT. The same considerations and requirements must also be carefully planned for existing and new apps or for moving existing apps into a cloud environment. Figure 1 includes a conceptual diagram of the BYOD problem domain and the areas that will be covered in this document.</para>
