# Plan your user and device groups
Removing the comments to test this list.

## Group basics

Groups in Intune provide great flexibility in managing your devices and users. You can set up groups to suit your organizational needs according to:


- geographic location
- department
- hardware characteristics
- operating system
- whether the device is user-owned or company-owned
