# Plan your user and device groups
<!--Write concisely: Considered planning of your groups and policies will help you keep them organized and achieve the client behavior that you want. Here are some the recommended practices for organizing and managing your Intune policies and groups.

## Group basics

Groups in Intune provide great flexibility in managing your devices and users. You can set up groups to suit your organizational needs according to:


- geographic location
- department
- hardware characteristics
- operating system
- whether the device is user-owned or company-owned

<!-- Move to Next steps: More information on how to create and manage groups can be found in [Use groups to manage users and devices with Microsoft Intune](use-groups-to-manage-users-and-devices-with-microsoft-intune.md)-->
