# Plan your user and device groups
Removing the comments to test this list.

## Group basics

Groups in Intune provide great flexibility in managing your devices and users. You can set up groups to suit your organizational needs according to:


- geographic location
- department
- hardware characteristics
- operating system
- whether the device is user-owned or company-owned

Now, how can I comment out a sentence?

Testing different comment options:

<!---
This is using the < and ! and dashes. Standared HTML commenting, in other words.
--->

And now, did the comment end? Can I see this sentence?

Ok, here's another comment format:

[//]: # "This is a true comment, using alleged MD format of some slashes and a pound."

And again, did the comment end? Can I see this sentence, take 2?
