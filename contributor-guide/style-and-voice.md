# Writing EMS documentation - style and voice

## 1. Focus on customer intent

People are reading your article to find an answer to a question. In most cases, they're looking for how to do something. Figure out what that something is, and focus the article on getting your reader to that answer:

- **Organize the article so the most common intent is near the top and other information appears later.** Consider these best practices:
	- For articles with a basic answer and more advanced options, put the basic information at the top and the advanced options afterward.
	- If information covers a different intent, link to it rather than including it in your article.
	- For articles with one procedure, put the procedure at the top followed by the conceptual information.

- **Make the most common task ridiculously easy to find.** Choose a technique based on what works best for your situation:
	- Put the intent in the title.
	- Put the intent in the first paragraph.
	- Put the intent in a procedure preceding the table of contents.
	- Put the intent in a section header.

## 2. Use everyday words

Like all the voice guidance, word choice guidance depends on context—the article, the product, the reader, the feature. Choose words based on context and aim for "easy to understand" for that context.

- **Use everyday words.** Many words have a formal and everyday version. For example: *provide* and *give*; *obtain* and *get*. Formal versions tend to be longer and have more syllables. That doesn't make them better or more precise. Using them just makes the sentence longer. These words have nothing to do with the technical content of the article but have a huge impact on how the article sounds.
- **Use a technical word if it's the right word.** In an article about AD FS, the phrase *server farm* is perfectly appropriate. In a domains article, the word *domain* is a good one to use. Understand your audience and use their everyday technical words.
- **Emphasize benefits, not technology.** When you choose words that focus on what the reader wants to do, the content is easier to understand. That is, the benefit is easier to understand than the underlying technology.

| Words emphasizing the benefit | Words emphasizing the underlying technology |
|---|---|
| To read email on your phone… | To enable mobile access by using Exchange ActiveSync… |
| Do you want to sign in once to all of the services in Office 365? | Do you want to deploy AD FS to your server farm in order to use federated identity? |
| Let people outside your company access shared documents in a security-enhanced manner. | Control access permissions for external users to your SharePoint Online site collections. |

- **Read the article aloud.** Does it sound natural? Aim to sound like a coworker talking to another professional.

## 3. Make the article easy to scan

People don't read our help articles like novels, from the first word to the last. They scan our articles for answers as if they were looking up a name in the phone book. Make articles easy to scan so they can find what they're looking for:

- **People scan titles, procedures, headers, art, and links.** After they find roughly what they're looking for, they then read for details.
- **Art is fantastic for drawing attention.** Might a screenshot help the reader find or understand something better?
- **Scan the article and see what jumps out.** Which procedure looks most important? Which intent seems to be the focus? Which tips are easy to find? Sometimes less important things get the focus and more important things are hidden. Can the wording, organization, and formatting be changed to address this?
- **Optimize for SEO**. Search engines look for clues to find help articles that match what our readers search for. And they look in many of the places people do: titles, headings, alt-text, links, as well as in the body, so make sure that you are using your search keywords in these areas. See [Search engine optimization](http://https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2781&topicid=36751) to learn how to optimize your content.

## 4. Write concisely

Customers prefer articles with fewer words:

- **Try to cut the word count by half.**
	- Introductions, conceptual information, and notes are good places to reduce wordiness.
	- Sentences using active voice instead of passive are usually shorter, and easier to understand.
- **Use everyday words to help with conciseness.** Formal words lead to formal sentences.
- **Read the article aloud.** If you're out of breath, the article is too wordy.

## 5. Show empathy, or at least, don't be rude

- **Remember that it's not us versus them.** Readers object to instructions that imply that Microsoft knows better than they do, and who can blame them? Our goal is to empower readers to solve problems, not to convince people that we're smarter than they are. Try to rephrase sentences that use phrases like "you must" and "you are required." Focus instead on the benefit of doing what will most likely solve the problem.
- **When you know that users are frustrated, consider acknowledging that.** Here are some places that apply:
	- An article that discusses how to resolve a really perplexing error
	- A community forum post that's a response to a thread of yelling customers
	- A time when any reasonable person would be annoyed by having to wait 72 hours for a domain to be ready
