# Microsoft 365 Enterprise overview
Microsoft 365 Enterprise is designed for large organizations and integrates Office 365 Enterprise, Windows 10 Enterprise, and Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) to empower everyone to be creative and work together, securely. Microsoft 365 Enterprise includes an enterprise edition of Windows 10 and Office applications through Office 365 ProPlus.

Both Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus provide new feature releases to the enterprise in March and September via the Semi-Annual Channel. A feature release of Semi-Annual Channel is supported for 18 months. Both Microsoft Intune and System Center Configuration Manager provide capabilities to deploy and update Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus.

This section provides an overview of the EMS and Office 365 services included with Microsoft 365 Enterprise and also introduces the core concepts necessary to understand how to best use it for your oganizational needs. These services provide capabilities that enable Microsoft cloud enterprise administrators to not just protect company employees’ identities and devices, but also control access to company data itself; both in transit and at rest.

|Service|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|[Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-whatis)|Azure AD provides a full suite of identity management capabilities including multi-factor authentication, device registration, self-service password management, self-service group management, role based access control, application usage monitoring, rich auditing and security monitoring and alerting.|
|[Azure AD Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection)|This service enables you to detect potential vulnerabilities affecting your organization’s identities and configure automated responses via conditional access policies to low, medium and high sign-in risk and user risk.|
|[Azure AD Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure)|This service enables organizations to minimize the number of people who have persistent access to privileged operations; Azure AD Privileged Identity Management introduces the concept of an eligible admin. Eligible admins should be users that need privileged access now and then, but not every day. The role is inactive until the user needs access, then they complete an activation process and become an active admin for a predetermined amount of time.|
|[Azure Information Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/information-protection/understand-explore/what-is-information-protection)| Azure Information Protection is a cloud-based solution, delivered as part of the EMS E5 offering, that helps an organization to classify, label, and protect its documents and emails. This can be done automatically by administrators who define rules and conditions, manually by users, or a combination where users are given recommendations. You use Azure Information Protection labels to apply classification to documents and emails. When you do this, the classification is identifiable at all times, regardless of where the data is stored or with whom it’s shared. <br><br>Azure Information Protection policy settings are protected by [Azure Rights Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/information-protection/understand-explore/what-is-azure-rms). Similar to how the labels that are applied, protection that is applied by using Rights Management stays with the documents and emails, independently of the location—inside or outside your organization, networks, file servers, and applications.|
|[Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/understand-explore/introduction-to-microsoft-intune)|Intune is a cloud-based enterprise mobility management (EMM) service that helps enable your workforce to be productive while keeping your corporate data protected. Intune integrates closely with Azure AD for identity and access control and is used for device and application management. [Intune’s device management](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/manage-settings-and-features-on-your-devices-with-microsoft-intune-policies) capabilities are used to configure and protect your user’s devices, including Windows PCs. <br><br>Intune device management capabilities support both [Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/enable-byod) enrollment which lets users enroll their personal phones, tablets, or PCs, and [Corporate-owned Device (COD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/issue-corp-devices) enrollment that enable management scenarios like automatic enrollment, shared devices, or pre-authorized enrollment requirement configurations. For added security, you can even require MFA to enroll a device. Once enrolled into management, Intune can configure device features and settings to enable secure access to company resources.|
