# Secure SharePoint Online sites in a dev/test environment

## Introduction

This article provides step-by-step instructions to create a dev/test environment that includes the four different types of SharePoint Online team sites for the [Secure SharePoint Online sites and files solution](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt842190.aspx). 

Use this dev/test environment to experiment with the information protection behaviors and fine tune settings for your specific needs before deploying SharePoint Online team sites in production.

## Phase 1: Create your dev/test environment
In this phase, you obtain trial subscriptions for Office 365 and Enterprise Mobility + Security for a fictional organization.

First, follow the instructions in **Phase 2** of the [Office 365 dev/test environment](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt736406.aspx).

Next, sign up for the **EMS trial subscription** and add it to the same organization as your Office 365 trial subscription, and then follow these steps:

1. If needed, sign in to the **Office 365 portal** with the credentials of the global administrator account of your trial subscription. For help, see [Where to sign in to Office 365](https://support.office.com/Article/Where-to-sign-in-to-Office-365-e9eb7d51-5430-4929-91ab-6157c5a050b4).
2. Click the **Admin** tile.
3. On the **Office Admin center** tab in your browser, in the left navigation, click **Billing > Purchase services**.
4. On the **Purchase services** page, find the **Enterprise Mobility + Security E5** item, and then hover your mouse pointer over it and click **Start free trial**.
5. On the **Confirm your order** page, click **Try now**.
6. On the **Order receipt** page, click **Continue**.

Next, enable the Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 license for your global administrator account.

1. On the **Office 365 Admin center** tab in your browser, in the left navigation, click **Users > Active users**.
2. Click your global administrator account, and then click **Edit for Product licenses**.
3. On the **Product licenses** pane, turn the product license for **Enterprise Mobility + Security E5** to **On**, click **Save**, and click **Close** two times.


## Phase 2: Create and configure your Azure Active Directory (AD) groups and users
In this phase, you create and configure the Azure AD groups and users for your fictional organization.

First, you must [connect with the Azure Active Directory V2 PowerShell module](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=842218).

Next, run these commands from the PowerShell command prompt or Integrated Script Environment (ISE):
```
$groupNames=@("C-Suite","IT staff","Research staff","Regular staff","Marketing staff","Sales staff")
ForEach ($element in $groupNames){ New-AzureADGroup -DisplayName $element -MailEnabled $false -SecurityEnabled $true -MailNickName "NotSet" }
```

Next, configure automatic licensing so that members of your groups are automatically assigned licenses for your Office 365 and EMS subscriptions, and then follow these steps:

1. Create a separate tab in your browser, and then go to the **Azure portal** at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com). If needed, sign in with the credentials of the global administrator account for your Office 365 E5 trial subscription.
2. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory > Licenses > All products**.
3. In the list, select **Enterprise Mobility + Security E5** and **Office 365 Enterprise E5**, and click **Assign**.
4. In the **Assign license** blade, click **Users and groups**.
5. In the list of groups, select the following:
 * C-Suite
 * IT staff
 * Research staff
 * Regular staff
 * Marketing staff
 * Sales staff
6. Click **Select**, and click **Assign**.
7. Close the Azure portal tab in your browser.

Next, fill in your organization name, your location, and a common password. Run the below commands from the PowerShell command prompt or Integrated Script Environment (ISE) to create user accounts. Then, add them to their corresponding groups.

```
$orgName="[organization name, such as contoso for the contoso.onmicrosoft.com trial subscription domain name]"
$location="[the ISO ALPHA2 country code, such as US for the United States]"
$commonPassword="[common password for all the new accounts]"

$PasswordProfile=New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.PasswordProfile
$PasswordProfile.Password=$commonPassword

$groupName="C-Suite"
$userNames=@("CEO","CFO","CIO") 
$groupID=(Get-AzureADGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupName }).ObjectID
ForEach ($element in $userNames){ 
New-AzureADUser -DisplayName $element -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile -UserPrincipalName ($element + "@" + $orgName + ".onmicrosoft.com") -AccountEnabled $true -MailNickName $element -UsageLocation $location 
Add-AzureADGroupMember -RefObjectId (Get-AzureADUser | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $element }).ObjectID -ObjectId $groupID
}
$groupName="IT staff"
$userNames=@("ITAdmin1","ITAdmin2") 
$groupID=(Get-AzureADGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupName }).ObjectID
ForEach ($element in $userNames){ 
New-AzureADUser -DisplayName $element -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile -UserPrincipalName ($element + "@" + $orgName + ".onmicrosoft.com") -AccountEnabled $true -MailNickName $element -UsageLocation $location 
Add-AzureADGroupMember -RefObjectId (Get-AzureADUser | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $element }).ObjectID -ObjectId $groupID
}
$groupName="Research staff"
$userNames=@("Researcher1") 
$groupID=(Get-AzureADGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupName }).ObjectID
ForEach ($element in $userNames){ 
New-AzureADUser -DisplayName $element -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile -UserPrincipalName ($element + "@" + $orgName + ".onmicrosoft.com") -AccountEnabled $true -MailNickName $element -UsageLocation $location 
Add-AzureADGroupMember -RefObjectId (Get-AzureADUser | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $element }).ObjectID -ObjectId $groupID
}
$groupName="Regular staff"
$userNames=@("Regular1", "Regular2") 
$groupID=(Get-AzureADGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupName }).ObjectID
ForEach ($element in $userNames){ 
New-AzureADUser -DisplayName $element -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile -UserPrincipalName ($element + "@" + $orgName + ".onmicrosoft.com") -AccountEnabled $true -MailNickName $element -UsageLocation $location 
Add-AzureADGroupMember -RefObjectId (Get-AzureADUser | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $element }).ObjectID -ObjectId $groupID
}
$groupName="Marketing staff"
$userNames=@("Marketing1", "Marketing2") 
$groupID=(Get-AzureADGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupName }).ObjectID
ForEach ($element in $userNames){ 
New-AzureADUser -DisplayName $element -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile -UserPrincipalName ($element + "@" + $orgName + ".onmicrosoft.com") -AccountEnabled $true -MailNickName $element -UsageLocation $location 
Add-AzureADGroupMember -RefObjectId (Get-AzureADUser | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $element }).ObjectID -ObjectId $groupID
}
$groupName="Sales staff"
$userNames=@("SalesPerson1") 
$groupID=(Get-AzureADGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupName }).ObjectID
ForEach ($element in $userNames){ 
New-AzureADUser -DisplayName $element -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile -UserPrincipalName ($element + "@" + $orgName + ".onmicrosoft.com") -AccountEnabled $true -MailNickName $element -UsageLocation $location 
Add-AzureADGroupMember -RefObjectId (Get-AzureADUser | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $element }).ObjectID -ObjectId $groupID
}
```

>[!Note]
>The use of a common password here is for automation and ease of configuration for a dev/test environment. This is not recommended for production subscriptions.
