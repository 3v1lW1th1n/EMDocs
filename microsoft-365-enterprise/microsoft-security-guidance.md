# Microsoft security guidance for political campaigns, nonprofits, and other agile organizations

## Introduction
If your organization is agile, you have a small IT team, and your threat profile is higher than average, this guidance is designed for you. This solution demonstrates how to quickly build an environment with essential cloud services that include secure controls from the start. This guidance includes prescriptive security recommendations for protecting data, identities, email, and access from mobile devices.

## Security solution guidance
This guidance describes how to implement a secure cloud environment. The solution guidance can be used by any organization. It includes extra help for agile organizations with BYOD access and guest accounts. You can use this guidance as a starting-point for designing your own environment.
