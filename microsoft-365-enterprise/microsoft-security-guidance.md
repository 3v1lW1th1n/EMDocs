This guidance includes prescriptive security recommendations for protecting data, identities, email, and access from mobile devices.

This guidance describes how to implement a secure cloud environment. The solution guidance can be used by any organization. It includes extra help for agile organizations with BYOD access and guest accounts. You can use this guidance as a starting-point for designing your own environment.
