# Architecture models and posters for Microsoft 365 Enterprise

## Introduction
These architecture models and posters provide recommended capabilities and architectures for adoption of enterprise cloud capabilities, starting with capabilities included in the Microsoft 365 Enterprise plans.

Many of these resources are large posters or other illustrations. These are provided in two formats — Visio and PDF. You can modify the Visio files for your own use.

>[!TIP]
>Most of the posters on this page are available in multiple languages, including Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. To download a poster in one of these languages, click the More languages link for that poster.

## Three tiers of protection for data, identities and devices
Microsoft provides many protection capabilities across our cloud services. We know it can be challenging to choose the right set of capabilities for your organization. These resources recommend the most common capabilities to help you secure your data, identities, and devices.

Capabilities are recommended in three tiers — baseline protection, sensitive protection, and protection for environments with highly regulated or classified data.

It’s important to use consistent levels of protection across your data, identities, and devices. For example, if you protect sensitive data at a higher level, be sure to protect the identities and devices that access this data at a comparable level. These resources show you which capabilities are comparable.

### Identity and Device Protection for Office 365 and other SaaS Apps
